        Matriculated students — students enrolled in a degree program — <em>italic - register</em> for courses to fulfill requirements in their selected majors. Matriculated students are assigned an
        academic adviser in their major, and work with the adviser to develop <a href="#">a program of study</a>.

      <p>
        Non-matriculated students — students enrolled in a non-degree program — register for courses for personal enrichment or exploration of majors. Non-matriculated students may take any
        undergraduate courses, as long as they have completed the course prerequisites.

      <p>
        Classes are small here (just 14 students on average), with a low student-teacher ratio of just 12:1. This means every student is known as an individual by his or her professors and peers, and
        every student’s ambitions are supported in full by our faculty, staff, and community. We also encourage you to pursue your personal interests through our clubs, athletics, and other
        nonacademic activities.
